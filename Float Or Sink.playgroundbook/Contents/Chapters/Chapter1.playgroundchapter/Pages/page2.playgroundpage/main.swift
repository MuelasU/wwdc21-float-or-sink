 # Pratice in SandBox
 
 ## Welcome to Sandbox 🕹️
 
 This playground page is a dedicated testing environment for you to apply what you've just learned in the previous page. Your object in SandBox is to guess what will be the behaviour of the ball in water: it will Float or Sink ❓

 In SandBox you have the control of two parameters of the ball: Weight and Volume. Try out some combinations of values and see what happens. Stay in mind what you've seen in previous page:
 
 * Callout(Recap):
 Apparent Weight = Real Weight - Displaced Water Weight
 
 You also have calculated the ball density, what is the relation between mass and volume. If I say that the water density is near to 1g/cm³, can you infer something?

 Thanks for your time and attention!
