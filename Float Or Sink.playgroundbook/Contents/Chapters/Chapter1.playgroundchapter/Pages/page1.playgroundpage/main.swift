 ## Physicist's thoughts üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
 
 Have you ever minded why do some objects sink in water while others don't?  ü§î

 That was a question that triggered me until my hydrodynamics classes in highschool. Being able to understand and have opportunity to explain to others what governs simple events such as that satisfy me a lot. Because of that, in this playground I pretend to teach you the physics behind the floatation (or not) of objects in water.

 To teach you the physics of floatation, grab your coat ü•º and enter the laboratory!

 ## What I've learned üìù
 
 In this playground page, we did an experiment with an object in water to study it behaviour. You've learned that wheter the total of water displaced weighs more than the object which displaced this amount of water, then the object floats. Else, the object sinks.
 
 That what you've just seen was stated by the greek Arquimedes a long time ago (246 BC) in _On Floating Bodies_ üìú
 
 * Callout(Arquimedes' Principle):
 Any object, totally or partially immersed in a fluid or liquid, is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.
 
 It is impressive how there were people with a scientific thought as advanced as Arquimedes in remote ages, isn't it?
 
 If you want to go further in this subject, [this article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/fluids/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle/a/buoyant-force-and-archimedes-principle-article) explains the physics beyound what you've just seen here.
 
 Now, let's move on to pratice what you've learned.
